1) Setup the autocomplete text view with choises of api keys. Put Api keys into the "strings" folder
as an array.
3) Setup Room.
4) Add Paging library v3.
5) Setup Navigation Arch component.
6) Create LoginFragment with 2 buttons -> "Login As A Guest", "Login via TMDB account".
"Login As A Guest" - will just generate a guest session. This is enough for a basic application usage.
"Login via TMDB account" - make a request to (/authentication/token/new) and wait for the response. After we've got the
response - redirect user here ("https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}"). This page will show
website with some buttons. After user clicks "Approve", the web page should contain the Authentication-Callback header with some url.
Having completed steps above - fire the /authentication/session/new request. It will generate the session_id which should be
used in order to get data from the TMDB.
